# Erc20Token

This is a cryptocurrency based on ERC 20. 
The contract written here describes a currency 4F4B2B97 which allows the non-partial transfer of tokens. 
All compulsory functions are defined here for it to be qualified as a valid ERC20 contract.

### This is also deployed on Ropsten Test Network.
Contract: 0xd2cc173fb118f6117524ab5703ee613b0f648178

Feel free to reach out to me for free tokens.

## Things planned for the future:
 - Allow mining of the currency.
 - Allow users to play games with this currency directly through the contract.
 - Write logic for reduction of total supply as people get the token more.
